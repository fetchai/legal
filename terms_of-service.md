However, in the near future, we intend to offer our services as a paid subscription service ("Subscription(s)"). Payments will be made in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). The billing cycles are established on either a monthly, 6-month, or annual basis, based on the type of subscription plan chosen upon purchasing a Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under identical conditions unless either you cancel it or the Company terminates it.

By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize the Company to charge all Subscription fees accrued through your Account to the designated payment instrument. In the event of automatic billing failure for any reason, the Company will generate an electronic invoice, stipulating that you must manually proceed, within a specified deadline date, with full payment corresponding to the billing period outlined on the invoice.

We reserve the right to decline or annul your order at any juncture for any reason, inclusive of but not confined to: service unavailability, inaccuracies in service description or pricing, errors in your order, or other grounds. Additionally, we reserve the right to reject or annul your order if suspected fraud or unauthorized or unlawful transaction activity is detected.

# 8\. Fee Changes

Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. The Company will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion and at any time, to change Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any alteration in Subscription fees shall take effect at the conclusion of the ongoing Billing Cycle.
